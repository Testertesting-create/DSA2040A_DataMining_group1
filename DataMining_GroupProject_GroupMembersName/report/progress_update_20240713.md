# Progress Update â€“ 2024-07-13

## Summary of Work Completed

### 1. Project Structure Setup
- Created the main project folder (`DataMining_GroupProject_GroupMembersName`) and all required subfolders:
  - `data/raw`, `data/transformed`, `data/final`
  - `notebooks` (with 4 placeholder .ipynb files)
  - `report` (with placeholder PDF and PPTX)
  - Added `requirements.txt`, `.gitignore`, and a comprehensive `README.md`

### 2. Repository Management
- Set up the GitHub repository: [https://github.com/Testertesting-create/DSA2040A_DataMining_group1](https://github.com/Testertesting-create/DSA2040A_DataMining_group1)
- Configured the remote to the correct team repo and pushed all changes to the `Nicholas_Work` branch
- Ensured all files and folders are tracked and up to date on GitHub

### 3. README and Documentation
- Drafted a detailed `README.md` including:
  - Group/project info (placeholders for names/IDs)
  - Project summary (OSMI Mental Health in Tech Survey 2014)
  - ETL summary and planned techniques
  - Tools used and instructions to run notebooks
  - Team Members & Contributions table
- Updated the `todo.md` to reflect all completed steps and added detailed ETL/data cleaning plans

### 4. Data Preparation Planning
- Inspected the OSMI dataset and identified formatting and consistency issues
- Added a step-by-step plan for preprocessing and cleaning the raw CSV (removing extra quotes/semicolons, standardizing missing values, etc.)
- Outlined improvements/expansions for the ETL pipeline, including:
  - Standardizing categorical variables
  - Handling advanced missing values
  - Feature engineering (age groups, region, binary flags)
  - Outlier detection
  - Modular, well-documented code

### 5. Next Steps
- Begin implementing the ETL notebook (`notebooks/1_extract_transform.ipynb`) to clean and prepare the dataset for analysis
- Continue updating documentation and todo as progress is made
- Assign and track contributions as the project advances
